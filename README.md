# Automated-Terrain-Bitmasks

An extremely rough proof of concept for generating terrain bitmasks autmatically from a template png image.

## Usage

The terrain template is currently loaded from addons/bitmask_automation/terrain-tilemap-template.png

Select a TileMapLayer in the node editor and choose "Terrain Templates" in the bottom menu.

Pick the source you want to apply the template to and then click apply.
